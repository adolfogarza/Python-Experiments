# Python-Request-Bot
Python classes that allow users to automate the process of fetching information from web forms. It prints all of the captured entries and provides the ability to export the response array on a comma separated file. An abstraction of a requestable form was created such that any subclass will inherit the common properties and functionality required.


## Usage Requirements:

* Have python 3.6 or higher.
* Install the python module called 'requests' locally.

## Execution:

```
python3 start.py
```
